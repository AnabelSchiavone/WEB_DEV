<span>High School:</span>
<br>
I have loved computers from a very young age. I was always wondering how electronic items such as cars, laptops, phones and televisions would work - I was fascinated. When I entered high school, I found that I enjoyed my Digital Technology class above all other subjects. This is what really encouraged me to pursue this potential dream.
<br> <!-- Line Breaks --> 
<br>
  After receiving first place in year 7 and 8 Digital Technology, I chose IST to be my 200hr elective in year 9 and 10. This was when i really started to find my love for IT. Due to my first place success in both year 9 and 10, I thought it would be a great idea to carry on IPT in year 11 and 12, a subject that I found joy in and success. As a result, I acheived a band 6 in the HSC and was awarded the NSW Distinguished scholars award for IPT.
